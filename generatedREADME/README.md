## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a command-line interface (CLI) application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

## Installation

Installation requirements include node.js and inquirer.js

## Usage 

You will find package dependency .json files in github repo that should allow inquirer to work without any further effort on your end. You will need to install node on your own. Installation options for node can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Credits

Special Thanks to Inquirer.js documentation:

## Contributing

In order to use this application, first clone the repo to your local machine. Then use the CLI to navigate to the main folder containing index.js. If you have node installed, you should be able to run the application using the command 'node index.js'

## Tests

Once this is done, you will be prompted to input the various sections of your README.md, as well as some contact information including your email address and github username. Once you have completed the final input (choosing your software license), your README.md file will be created and added to the generatedREADME folder found within the main folder.
